# Getting Started with Create React App

Hello. So basically this Project is a copy of windows 7. 
You have a Taskbar which has the same features as normal Windows. 
In  the Taskbar you have Menu which opens up all the projects that I have created
On the right side of Menu you have Google-clone.
I am taking the data of Google via their API.
Next to Google I have Control Panel.
You open up the Control Panel and you can see Uninstall Button. You press on it and he 
automatically removes an Icon. 
On the right corner you have a Clock
On the left of the Clock you have TaskBar Items.
They have a hover effect to show some text, you can click on them and you can see everything that you couldnt see in such a long time because Windows 10.
I would say that basically all of it
